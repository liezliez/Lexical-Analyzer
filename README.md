# LexicalAnalyzer

Lexers and parsers are most often used for compilers, but can be used for other computer language tools, such as prettyprinters or linters. Lexing can be divided into two stages: the scanning, which segments the input string into syntactic units called lexemes and categorizes these into token classes; and the evaluating, which converts lexemes into processed values.

Lexical analysis is also an important early stage in natural language processing, where text or sound waves are segmented into words and other units. This requires a variety of decisions which are not fully standardized

# How this program Works
This program will ask the user to enter input in the form of a String that is stored in the global variable 'inp'. then the program will automatically read the String, and this program will check it letter by letter until all the input Strings are checked or a char of the String is considered "Error" then this program will stop after the program has performed all checks on the input or when the input is "Error"

# How to
This Program was CLI Based so To give the input just use terminal application
